 create E-R model in PostgreSQL, you would create a table for the Person entity with appropriate columns. Here's how you can do it

        CREATE TABLE Person (
            person_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            first_name VARCHAR(50),
            last_name VARCHAR(50),
            company_name VARCHAR(100),
            address VARCHAR(255),
            city VARCHAR(100),
            state VARCHAR(2),
            zip VARCHAR(20),
            phone1 VARCHAR(20),
            phone2 VARCHAR(20),
            email VARCHAR(100),
            department VARCHAR(100)
        );


This SQL script creates a table named Person with columns corresponding to the attributes defined in the E-R model. Some considerations:

SERIAL PRIMARY KEY: This creates an auto-incrementing integer column named person_id, which serves as the primary key.
VARCHAR(n): This specifies variable-length character strings, where n is the maximum length of the string.
state VARCHAR(2): Assuming the state abbreviations will always be two characters long.
Ensure that the lengths specified for VARCHAR columns are appropriate for your data.
Once you execute this script in your PostgreSQL database, you'll have a table named Person ready to store the data according to your E-R model
