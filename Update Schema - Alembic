To implement a mechanism to create or update the schema in PostgreSQL, you can use migration tools like Alembic.
Alembic allows you to define changes to your database schema in Python scripts called "migrations."
These migrations can then be applied to your database to create or update the schema as needed.


1.Install Alembic:
   
   First, install Alembic using pip:

   ---bash
   pip install alembic
   ---

2. Initialize Alembic:

   Navigate to your project directory and run the following command to initialize Alembic:

   ---
   alembic init alembic
   ---

   This command creates an `alembic` directory in your project with necessary configuration files.

3. Configure Alembic:

   Modify the `alembic.ini` file to specify your database connection string. Update the `sqlalchemy.url` parameter with your PostgreSQL database connection string.

4. Create Migration Scripts:

   Use Alembic to generate migration scripts based on changes to your database schema. For example, if you want to create the `person` table, you can generate a migration script with the following command:

   ---
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Create person table"
   ---

   This command generates a new migration script in the `alembic/versions` directory based on the current state of your database models.

5. Apply Migrations:

   Once you have created migration scripts, you can apply them to your database to create or update the schema. Use the following command to apply migrations:

   ---
   alembic upgrade head
   ---

   This command applies all pending migrations to the database.

6. Updating Schema:

   Whenever you make changes to your database schema, generate a new migration script using the `alembic revision` command. Alembic will compare the current state of your database with the changes you've made and generate a migration script accordingly.
