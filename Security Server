To enforce access restrictions between the API server and the PostgreSQL database, as well as between the CentOS server and the database, you can implement firewall rules and PostgreSQL authentication settings.

Restrict API server access to the PostgreSQL database:

Configure the PostgreSQL database to listen only on localhost (127.0.0.1) by setting the listen_addresses parameter in postgresql.conf.
Modify the pg_hba.conf file to allow connections only from localhost and the API server's IP address. This ensures that only the API server can access the database.
Restrict CentOS server access to the PostgreSQL database:

Ensure that the CentOS server's firewall blocks all incoming connections to the PostgreSQL port (default is 5432) from external sources except for the PostgreSQL database server.
Configure the PostgreSQL database to authenticate clients connecting from the CentOS server using password authentication or other secure methods. Ensure that only authorized users can access the database.
Here's an example of how you can configure the firewall and PostgreSQL settings:

Firewall Configuration on CentOS Server:

# Allow outgoing traffic
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT

# Allow incoming PostgreSQL traffic only from the PostgreSQL server
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5432 -s <postgres_server_ip> -j ACCEPT

# Drop all other incoming traffic to PostgreSQL port
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5432 -j DROP

# Save the rules
sudo iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables

--------
Replace <postgres_server_ip> with the IP address of the PostgreSQL server.

PostgreSQL Configuration:
Edit postgresql.conf:
# Listen only on localhost
listen_addresses = 'localhost'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit pg_hba.conf:

# Allow connections from the API server
host    all             all             <api_server_ip>/32     md5

# Allow local connections
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5

# Reject all other connections
host    all             all             all                     reject


--------------------------------------
Replace <api_server_ip> with the IP address of the API server.

After making these changes, restart the PostgreSQL service for the settings to take effect.
Ensure that your PostgreSQL database users have appropriate permissions to access the database. Additionally, consider using SSL encryption for secure communication between the API server and the database.
With these configurations, access to the PostgreSQL database is restricted to only the API server and the PostgreSQL server itself. 
The CentOS server will not be able to connect to the database unless explicitly allowed.
